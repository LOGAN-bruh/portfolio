### Calculator (2025)

This Processing code creates a fully functional retro-style calculator GUI modeled after the Apple II aesthetic, featuring a number pad, operators, and display. It supports basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, as well as exponentiation (^), square root (√), rounding (R), negation (±), and decimal input. The calculator's interface includes numeric buttons (0–9) and operation buttons, each rendered as custom Button objects that respond visually when hovered over. The display at the top shows the current input or result in a green retro font against a dark background. The logic tracks the left (l) and right (r) operands, the selected operation (op), and whether the calculator should reset the display on the next input. Special features like clear (C), backspace (D), and error handling (e.g., division by zero shows "Error :(") are also integrated. The GUI is polished with stylized text like “Apple Computer Inc.® (1977)” and “Apple II Calculator,” giving it a vintage appearance while offering modern calculator functionality.
